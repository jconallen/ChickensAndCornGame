		<p>
		I created this 100% client side JavaScript implementation of the Chick and Corn game 
		as part of a class assignment for my DCS907 Algorithms class. I proposed this assignment  
		after working on another assignment where we were asked analyze the problem and solutions
		for the game.  We were pointed to a web implementation of the game/puzzle, and while that
		implementation was OK, it lacked significant documentation of how the chickens moved.  This
		and other minor problems with that implementation led be to the idea of producing one of
		my one, and one in which instead of only playing the game manually, I could allow JavaScript
		implementations of the algorithms to be supplied and executed.
